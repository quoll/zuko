# Zuko

This is a Clojure/ClojureScript library that works with other Threatgrid data applications.
The initial applications using this library are
[Naga](https://github.com/threatgrid/naga) and [Asami](https://github.com/threatgrid/asami).

This library provides functionality for:
- Managing data (especially JSON data) in a graph database.
- Projecting data into tuples suitable for query results or insertion into a graph database.
- General utilities to avoid duplicating code between projects.

```

In `deps.edn`:

```clojure

    org.clojars.quoll/zuko {:mvn/version "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"}
